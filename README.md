Term [life insurance](https://insurelife.store/term-vs-whole-life-insurance-which-is-better/) is like renting a homeâ€”it provides coverage for a specific period, usually 10, 20, or 30 years. If you pass away during the term, your beneficiaries receive a death benefit. If you outlive the term, the policy expires unless you renew it.
